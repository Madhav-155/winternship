When I began my internship at **IIT Ropar**, I assumed the learning would follow a familiar structure—tasks to complete, concepts to absorb, and outcomes to deliver. Two weeks in, I realize the experience has been far more subtle and far more meaningful. What stands out most is not a single assignment or session, but the way this internship has quietly reshaped how I think, question, and engage with ideas.

A significant part of this journey has been the collaborative learning environment, especially during **Zoom breakout room discussions**. These sessions go beyond routine interaction. They are spaces where case studies are unpacked collectively, assumptions are challenged, and ideas evolve through conversation. Listening to peers articulate their thought processes, questioning one another, and refining ideas together has been one of the most enriching aspects of the experience. Even in a virtual setting, there is a strong sense of shared curiosity and collective problem-solving.

Building **code from scratch** has been another defining element of the internship. Instead of starting with predefined templates or solutions, we are encouraged to understand the problem deeply and then construct our approach step by step. This process has reinforced the importance of clarity, structure, and intention in both thinking and implementation. Writing code this way forces patience, but it also builds confidence—confidence in understanding the fundamentals rather than relying on shortcuts.

What I appreciate most is the emphasis on **depth over speed**. There is no pressure to rush to an answer. Questions are welcomed, confusion is treated as part of the learning process, and reflection is encouraged. Brainstorming sessions often lead to multiple possible directions, and exploring those possibilities has helped me become more comfortable with open-ended problems and uncertainty.

In just two weeks, I have noticed a shift in how I approach challenges. I am more deliberate in my reasoning, more open to discussion, and more comfortable saying that I do not have an answer yet. This mindset, I have learned, is not a weakness but a starting point for genuine understanding.

This internship at **IIT Ropar** is not simply adding to my technical skills; it is shaping how I learn, collaborate, and think. The experience so far has been a reminder that meaningful growth does not always come from dramatic moments but often from quiet, consistent engagement with ideas, people, and problems. As I move forward, I am genuinely looking forward to continuing this process—learning deeply, questioning thoughtfully, and growing steadily.
