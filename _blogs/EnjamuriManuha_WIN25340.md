My First Internship: More Than Just an Internship

A Nervous Beginning and a New Perspective
On the first day of my first internship, the schedule was from 9 AM to 6 PM continuously, with only a few short breaks. 
I was honestly scared after seeing the timings. I felt worried that I would not have time for my personal growth. 
But as the days passed, I realized that instead of losing time, I was actually finding myself. I finally understood 
where I was standing, what I was lacking, and how I could improve.

The Moment My Perspective Shifted
The very first inaugural session itself was an eye-opening experience for me. I finally understood the true 
meaning of AI — that it is not about replacing humans, but about how we can use AI to improve development, 
productivity, and creativity. At that moment, I realized that this was not going to be just an internship. 
It changed the way I look at technology and also the way I see my future.

From Watching to Doing: Real Learning Begins
Learning here does not stop with watching videos. After completing the modules, we move into hands-on case studies, 
especially around the MERN stack, where real thinking and problem-solving begin. This was the first time I experienced 
learning that truly challenged me, and it made me feel like I was slowly becoming a real developer, not just a student.

Morning Energy and the Power of Good Mentorship
Every day at 9 AM during the stand-up sessions, I see our teachers — Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi Ma’am, 
Sakshi Ma’am, Bhavna Ma’am, Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, and Nitin Shankar Sir — bringing such positive energy. 
The way Meenakshi Ma’am starts the day with a smile fills me with the same positivity. The session by Sudarshan Sir always 
boosts motivation, gives good direction, and reminds me why I chose this field. The fellow interns make each session more 
interesting and lively. The way Nandhan Sir explains the ViBe course, along with the extra sessions he takes, helped us learn 
beyond expectations. The sessions by Sakshi Ma’am were especially interesting because they taught us much more than just MERN; 
they helped us think better and learn deeply every day.

Two Weeks That Changed My Routine and My Mindset
We have completed only two weeks of the internship, and in this short time I have learned so much. It did not just improve 
my subject knowledge; it completely changed my daily routine, my focus, and my discipline. Life before the internship and life 
after the internship are not the same. Every single day gives me a new chance to change, to grow, and to become better. I stopped 
doom scrolling, I started waking up early so I would never miss the 9 AM stand-up, and I now try to improve myself a little more 
every day. These small habits make me proud, especially because this is my very first internship.

Learning Designed With Care and Depth
Sudarshan Sir and the entire team continuously introduce new activities that make learning enjoyable and meaningful. They conduct 
live polls during Zoom sessions, quizzes, interactive discussions, and special learning sessions. This internship values depth over 
speed, and that completely changed the way I approach learning.

A Dream Fulfilled and a Heart Full of Gratitude
Overall, this experience has been truly life-changing. It transformed the way I think, study, and focus. Studying in an IIT 
has always been a dream for me, and in this form, through this internship, I feel that dream has been fulfilled. As my first 
internship, this journey will always remain special to me. Above all, I feel deep gratitude and thankfulness toward all the 
teachers who work so hard for our growth, not just as developers, but as individuals.
